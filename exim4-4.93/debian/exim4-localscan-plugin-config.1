.SH "NAME"
exim4\-localscan\-plugin\-config \- get information necessary to build and package exim4 plugins
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBexim4\-localscan\-plugin\-config\fR \fB\-\-localscan\-abiversion\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBexim4\-localscan\-plugin\-config\fR
is a tool that is used to determine various things needed to build plugins (shared libraries) for the Exim MTA. Currently there is one such plugin API \- the
\fBlocal_scan\fR
API. In addition to local_scan plugins, this API is also available to shared libraries used with the ${dlfunc ...} expansion item.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Since
\fBexim4\-localscan\-plugin\-config\fR
is
Debian(TM)\-specific, it currently takes a single mandatory option parameter,
\fB\-\-localscan\-apiversion\fR, outputting the API/ABI version (\fIver\fR). Packages containing local_scan plugins should depend on exim4\-localscanapi\-\fIver\fR
