.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eximon

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Exim monitor is an application which displays in an X window information
about the state of 
.B Exim's
queue and what
.B Exim is doing.
An admin user can perform certain operations on messages from this GUI
interface; however all such facilities are also available from the command
line, and indeed, the monitor itself makes use of the command line to
perform any actions requested.

This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff
than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches
