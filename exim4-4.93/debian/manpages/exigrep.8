.SH NAME
EXIGREP \- Search Exim's main log
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exigrep
.I [\-l] pattern [log file] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B exigrep
utility is a Perl script that searches one or more main log files for
entries that match a given pattern.
When it finds a match, it extracts all the log entries for the relevant
message, not just those that match the pattern.
Thus,
.B exigrep
can extract complete log entries for a given message, or all mail for a given
user, or for a given host, for example.

The
.I \-l
flag means \(oqliteral\(cq, that is, treat all characters in the pattern as
standing for themselves.
Otherwise the pattern must be a Perl regular expression.
The pattern match is case-insensitive.
If no file names are given on the command line, the standard input is
read.

If the location of a
.B zcat
command is known from the definition of ZCAT_COMMAND in Local/Makefile,
.B exigrep
automatically passes any file whose
name ends in COMPRESS_SUFFIX through
.B zcat
as it searches it.

.SH BUGS
This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff
than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches
would be greatly appreciated.
