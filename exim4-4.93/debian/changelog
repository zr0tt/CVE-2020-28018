    GIT master branch. Fix pgsql lookup for multiple result-tuples with a

    https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20171223.102237.a53dd5bd.en.html
  * Simplify debian/rules and make it usable with dh v10 compat. The
    fine-grained support for selecting the to be built packages (-custom with
    or without -base) was dropped. The build process is now controlled by
    attaching tasks to dh-override hooks instead of using file dependencies,
    makefile-style.  The latter broke with dh v10 due to upstream's
    build-system which always has the main targets out-of-date inter alia due
    to the compile-number feature.
  * Use hardening=+all instead of hardening=+bindnow,+pie. (Does not change
    buildflags ATM.)
  * Use debhelper v10 compat.
  * Drop override_dh_strip-arch, we have had enough toolchain and
    source changes to prevent file conflicts.

      targets instead of listing all dh-commands. While this is uglier and
      slows things down a bit it shortens debian/rules by 40 lines and has the
      huge benefit that we automatically use all suggested helpers in correct
      order.
    + Drop unused variables combinedidbgpackage/dhcombinedidbgpackage.
    + Delete unused, commented code.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/tests/control: Add missing python test dependency, as
    debian/tests/security calls python. Closes: #740092

  [ Andreas Metzler ]
  * 4.82 deprecated $tls_bits, $tls_certificate_verified, $tls_cipher,
    $tls_peerdn, $tls_sni and introduced tls_in_*/tls_out_* variants of these
    variables which describe the respective status of the current incoming or
    outgoing TLS connection. The rationale for this is that a single exim
    process can now use both an incoming (message reception) and outgoing
    TLS connection (callout or cutthrough delivery) concurrently. With this
    change the "old" variables were mapped to tls_in_*, i.e. they expand to
    empty values on outgoing connections. (This is not yet documented.)
    Outgoing tls-connections can therefore not be detected by nonempty
    $tls_cipher anymore. exim4-config << 4.82 used this mechanism to prevent
    sending of plaintext AUTH information on unencrypted connections. Force a
    lockstep upgrade of exim4-config by bumping the version of exim4-base's
    dependency on exim4-config to >= 4.82.

    documented in LSB and required by lsb-base (>= 4.1+Debian9).

  * Improve exim4-config_files.5 and README.Debian - Warn about unresolvable
    items in host lists. Closes: #627988
  * Drop support for "/etc/init.d/exim4 what". It offers zero benefit to
    invoking exiwhat directly and throws an error mesage, too. (Thanks Regid
    Ichira for the diagnosis.) Closes: #643720
  * Set "host_find_failed = ignore" (instead of defer) on smarthost and
    hub_user_smarthost router. Now if one (of the possibly multiple) listed
    smarthosts is not resolvable (NXDOMAIN) ignores it and and tries the next
    listed one. If all listed hosts are unresolvable the mail is still
    defered, since host_all_ignored is set to defer by default. Therefore the
    behavior does not change for single-smarthost systems. Closes: #658878
  * Remove obsolete conffile /etc/cron.monthly/exim4-base which was only
    shipped in 4.69-3. Closes: #689334
  * Update exim_db.8, syncing  against spec.txt from exim 4.80.
  * 87_localinjected_mimeacl.diff from upstream GIT. When injecting a message
    locally in non-SMTP mode, and with MIME ACLs configured, if the ACL
    rejected the message, Exim would try to `fprintf(NULL, "%s",
    the_message)`. This fixes that.

      80_TLS1.2-and-TLS1.1-support.diff)
    + New expansion conditions, "inlist", "inlisti".
    + Exim no longer performs string expansion on the second string of
      the match_* expansion conditions: "match_address", "match_domain",
      "match_ip" & "match_local_part". Named lists can still be used.  The
      previous behavior made it too easy to create (remotely) vulnerable
      configurations. A more detailed rationale and explanation can be found
      on
      https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20111003.122326.fbcf32b7.en.html
    + doc/pcrepattern.txt is not shipped anymore as part of the exim tarball
      (and therefore the Debian package suite.)
  * Make use of /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk if available.
  * Change build system to build each binary variant in a separate copy of
    the source tree instead of re-using the copy and moving away the results
    after build. The old approach stopped working since upstream added a
    dependency on make all to make install. - As we were changing parts of
    tree (Local/Makefile) after the build this caused an (incorrect) rebuild
    on make install.

    + 1_cfile_norw_eximuid: Don't allow a configure file which is writeable by
      the Exim user or group.
    + 2_permcheck_configurefile: Check configure file permissions even for
      non-default files if still privileged.
    + 3_remove_ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY: Remove ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY build option,
      effectively making it always true.
    + 4_FD_CLOEXEC: Set FD_CLOEXEC on SMTP sockets after forking in the
      daemon, to ensure  that rogue child processes cannot use them.
    + 5_TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST: Add TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST compile option.
    + 6_nonroot_system_filter_user: If the system filter needs to be run as
      root, let that be explicitly configured.  The default is now the Exim
      run-time user.
    + 7_filter_D_option: Add a (compiletime) whitelist of acceptable values
      for the -D option.
    + 8_updatedocumentation: Update documentation to reflect the changes.
  * Build with WHITELIST_D_MACROS=OUTGOING. Post patch 7_filter_D_option exim
    will not regain root privileges (usually necessary for local delivery) if
    the -D option was used. Macro identifiers listed in WHITELIST_D_MACROS are
    exempted from this restriction. mailscanner (4.79.11-2.2) uses -DOUTGOING.
  * Build with TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST=/etc/exim4/trusted_configs. Post patch
    3_remove_ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY exim will not re-gain root privileges
    (usually necessary for local delivery) if the -C option was used. This
    makes it impossible to start a fully functional damon with an alternate
    configuration file. /etc/exim4/trusted_configs (can) contain a list of
    filenames (one per line, full path given) to which this restriction does
    not apply.

      * Add exim4-daemon-heavy.templates, exim4-daemon-light.templates
        and exim4.templates to POTFILES.in

exim4 (4.63-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make update-exim4.conf man page also update-exim4.conf.conf man page.
  * Fix SPF error message when $sender_address_domain is undefined (i.e. sender
    is <>). (rm)
  * Change debian/rules documentation for daemon-custom build.
    Thanks to Guido Hennecke. Closes: #386135
  * Rotate paniclog by size, not daily, to avoid rotating away
    messages after complaining from the daily cron job.
    Thanks to Dirk Meyer.
  * Update Slovak translation.
    Thanks to Peter Mann.
  * Add Wolof translation.
    Thanks to M Mamoune Mbacke
  * Add a paragraph explaning the gnutls-bin suggestion to ease DH
    parameter generation in case of entropy starvation.
    Thanks to Andi Barth and Florian Weimer.
  * Since a new version of sysvinit upload will move /var/run/ to a tmpfs
    directories under /var/run/ and their permissions are not persistent
    anymore but will be lost after a reboot. - Re-generate /var/run/exim4 in
    the init script to compensate for this. (am) (closes: #387699)
  * update-exim4.conf: Exit with an error if dc_use_split_config is neither
    true nor false instead of replacing the configuration with an empty one.
    (am) Closes: #386554
  * More intelligence for exim4_refresh_gnutls-params:
    * If certtool (from gnutls-bin) is unavailable but openssl is installed
      use openssl to re-generate DH params. (am)
    * Change exim4-base Suggests on gnutls-bin to gnutls-bin|openssl. (am)
    * Move invocation and background mechanism to exim4_refresh_gnutls-params.
      Script can now be called any time from the command line or any
      other script.
    * Only regenerate dh params if tls_advertise_hosts is non empty.
      According to Florian Weimer, DH params are only needed for
      incoming TLS connections.
    * Thanks, Yuri D'Elia. This addresses #387448
  * Improve entropy and gnutls-params docs.
  * cron-daily:
    * Invoke exim4_refresh_gnutls-params unconditionally.
    * Send out e-mail alert if gnutls-params is older than 14 days.
    * rename config varables to E4BCD_, source /etc/default/exim4
    * introduce a E4BCD_PANICLOG_NOISE variable containing a regexp.
      Paniclog is negatively filtered against that regexp and paniclog
      warning is only sent out if unfiltered lines remain. This is to allow
      work around http://www.exim.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=92
  * Prepare hosts_avoid_tls statement on SMTP transports
  * Macroize log_selector, remove +tls_cipher from examples (it is on
    by default) and always set tls_peerdn (we use TLS by default for
    outgoing connections). Make it easier to enable debug logging.
  * Mention in the comments of the default RCPT ACL that verification
    is likely to have false negatives in smarthost/satellite setups. This
    is the easiest way to fix #388460; the "real" fix would be very very
    complicated and thus unsuitable for the default configuration.
    Closes: #388460
  * README.Debian:
    * Re-Work "misc" section to contain subsection. Fix minor
      formatting issues.
    * Add a section about SELinux to the misc subsection saying that
      we currently do not have an SELinux policy but would appreciate
      people helping here. This is already bug #387327 and #390179.

  * re-order RCPT ACL statements to resemble Upstreams default config
    a little more. This used to be the case in the beginning, but was
    changed eventually, and I didn't find any rationale for our deviation.
    Thus, we change back to upstream's default to see which things might
    break.

  * Bug Fixes
    - preserve escape sequences like '\\N' in

      - use awk instead of sed in exim4-config.postinst (Thanks, Barry Kitson).
      - use printf '%s\n' "$foo" instead of echo "$foo". (echo in dash would
        swallow the second backslash)
      - actually making this work requires changes in debconf, too,
        see #306134.
      - (Closes: #305957) (am)
    - apply upstream patch from
      http://www.exim.org/mail-archives/exim-users/Week-of-Mon-20050425/msg00035.html
      in some circumstances, exim writes parts of /etc/passwd and/or
      /etc/group to the reject log. This scares people. (mh)
    - apply upstream patch from
      http://www.exim.org/mail-archives/exim-dev/2005-April/msg00012.html to
      only try SASL mechanisms that are actually specified in the

      /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template to allow macros here as well. (mh)
    - Make it clear that "broken debconf" warning is issued by
      exim4-config.postinst
    - Make sure that "generated, do not touch" disclaimer in
      /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated always appears
    - [exim4-config] As the.config script stores answers in debconf's db and the
      postinst actually generates configurations files from these values
      restarting the daemon on dpkg-reconfigure has to be done in postinst. (am)

exim4 (4.43-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now that 4.44 is released upload 4.43 to unstable. ;-) Merge experimental
    and unstable changelog.
  * More lintian overrides. ("X" in eximon4's description has to be capital,
    and we take care to only use settitle if it is available.
  * make nullmailer setup and the way we use mailname a lot more sensible,
    attacking #244095 and #280207:
    - mailname is not implicitely made a local domain, instead it is listed
      explicitly in dc_other_hostnames, where users can easily remove it
      from. (This is basically what postfix does, too.) When upgrading
      existing installations mailname is automatically added _once_ to
      dc_other_hostnames, on fresh installations mailname is the default
      value of dc_other_hostnames. We store the fact that we have added
      mailname to dc_other_hostnames in $dc_mailname_in_oh in
      update-exim4.conf.conf.
    - Make exim work correctly if dc_readhost ("visible, rewritten domain name
      for local users") ends up as part of local_domain, which happens if
      the same value is chosen for mailname and dc_readhost. This
      implemented by new router, hub_user_smarthost. Previously users were
      required to use something different (my.invalid.domain) for mailname.
    - Special thanks to Christian Perrier for taking care of the
      template translation updates.
  * We did not substitute the current value into the debconf templates with
    db_subst but showed the old ones from the previous debconf run.
  * /etc/exim4/email-addresses is ignored now, please use /etc/email-addresses!
  * Bosnian (bs.po) translation is complete (Thanks Adis Nezirovic).
  * Includes de.po change suggested in #286525.
  * One-line fix for incorrect fi.po translation by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo.

  * Urgency high because upgrades from woody were broken.
  * Exim4 triggers a bug in woody's debconf. - With dialog frontend, invoked
    by dpkg-preconfigure you are stuck in a loop, always being asked the same
    two questions (split config, and basic configtype) again and again until
    you give up and choose split_config=yes although being discouraged from
    doing so. I am working around this by making the config-script abort if
    debconf is old and we are running in preconfigure mode. (Thanks to Dan

  * Add comment in configuration file documenting that effective retry times
    depend on _both_ retry-rules and frequency of queue running. Keep
    default QUEUEINTERVAL at 30m because running the queue can be quite
    expensive and because therespective RFCs suggest 30m as minimal waiting
    time. (Closes: #242426)
  * Installation over serial console/minicom only has a screen size of 80
    characters x 24 lines available. Sigh. Shorten config-type question by
    cutting down the introduction. (Closes: #244464). Shorten relay-net
    question by replacing a unnecessarily complicated formulation with a
    clearer one which closes: #226809.
  * Debconf supports masquerading as a different host with rewriting not only
    for "satellite" but also for "smarthost" system. (Closes: #229911).
    - Introduces another but hopefully last pre-sarge template change.
      (This includes final versions of the templates without the dead
      references to "satellite" which closes: #229902.)
    - Rewrite /this/ stuff at smtp transport time. /etc/email-addresses
      rewriting still uses normal rewriting because it always has and because
      it is easier to setup.
    - This still does not address one basic issue, the misuse of /etc/mailname
      for qualifying recipeints because this needs clarification in policy
      _and_ changing MUAs to not do this. Therefore I declare this post-sarge.
    - Thanks to Chris Cheney for the kick, and to Adam Conrad and Wouter
      Verhelst for their help.
  * Add two fixes from upstream:
    - Change 4.31/55 was buggy and broke sender address rewriting and caching.
    - Change 4.24/6 broke the SIGALRM handler with deliver_drop_privilege.
  * README.TLS.gz and the actual configuration disagreed (Thanks, Richard

exim4 (4.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 4.32 (exiscan 4.32-17)
    - includes the fix for the caching bug and uses MAIL FROM <> as default
      value for recipient callouts again.
    - new exiscan adds a local "Received:" header to the copy passed to
      spamassassin tofix evaluation of DNS lists, compensating for
      ChangeLog 4.31/66. (Closes: #242730)
  * Remove obsolete reference to auth_over_tls_hosts from documentation.
    (Thanks Jonas Meurer)
  * Enable SMTP authentication (hosts_try_auth) per default when sending
    mail to smarthost. No need to edit the configuration-file anymore if you
    just need to forward all mail to a smarthost with AUTH. (Closes: #203307)
  * Hungarian translation of debconf templates by VEROK Istvan.
    (Closes: #242931)
  * remove "exim 3 will stay default MTA for Debian sarge" from
    README.Debian as TPTB have decided otherwise. (Closes: #243687).
  * Rewrite "Sender:"-header for "satellite" configuration profile, too.
    (Closes: #228978)
  * Use the normal user account set-up during installation as default
    destination for delivery of mail for root. (Joey Hess)
  * Shorten exim4/dc_postmaster template to fit on console. (Joey Hess)
    (Closes: #242303)
  * In template suggest using real-foo to force local delivery.
    (Closes: #229909)
  * Template changes reviewed by debian-l10n-english. There might still be
    more changes, translators should probably wait a little bit longer before
    updating the translation.
  * On fresh installations smarthost profile only listens on loopback per
    default. - There are valid uses of "smarthost" that require listening on
    public interfaces but the most common one (dialup) does not.
  * Ship README.Debian.UUCP by Andreas Barth in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base. -
    This resolves our part of #201153.

  * Italian translation of debconf templates by Danilo Piazzalunga.
    (Closes: #237500)
  * Rewrite generation of /etc/aliases because it was broken when running
    under debbian-installer/debootstrap, which installs the packages with
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=nointeractive and reconfigures them later (report by
    Florian Effenberger). (am)
    Instead of generating it _once_ and touching it never again ask for and
    add alias for root if it is missing. Debconf template
    exim4/dc_noalias_regenerate is not used any more. (Closes: #237524)

  * To increase robustness set explicit "domains = +local_domains" on all the
    routers that are supposed to be handling _only_ local mail (i.e. anything
    after dnslookup or smarthost) instead of relying on the no_more.

    If the router handling remote addresses was modified by adding a
    precondition the address would have wrongly been handled by the later
    routers if the precondition failed, breaking at least "verify = sender".
    (Closes: #230403) (am)
  * In the data ACL add a Message-ID header to mails injected with SMTP from
    +relay_from_hosts. (Exim stopped doing this by default in 4.30.) (mh)
  * binary-all metapackage exim4 does not depend anymore on exim4-base with
    exactly the same version. There is no necessity for dependencies that
    strict and it broke both binary NMUs and installability on lagging
    architectures. (Closes: #231678) (am)
  * Give way to the "I use sid but keep it outdated by not running apt-get
    upgrade ever."-fraction. exim4-base now depends on working versions of

    for more than 6 months. (Closes: #230423,#230836,#231111) (am)

    need to merge in each small change manually) for increased stability.

exim4 (4.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * update-exim4.conf works without daemon-package (Closes:#195329)
  * Add dnslookup_relay_to_domains router for "internet" config to
    allow relaying for domains with an MX pointing to an rfc1918
    address. (Closes: #198410) (MH)
  * update-exim4.conf would hang if one of the subdirectories in conf.d
    was empty. (Report and fix by Marc Merlin)
  * Build-Depend on libgnutls7
  * Preserve comments in update-exim4.conf.conf by first adding missing
    items and replacing the values with sed instead of regenerating file
    from scratch (Closes: #184099)
  * Set return_path_add, delivery_date_add and envelope_to_add for
    maildir-transport (Closes: #196178)
  * Use email-addresses file in /etc/ instead of in /etc/exim4 as exim3 does,
    exim4-config now needs to conflict with exim,exim-tls. We still include
    code for evaluating the old file if it exist, but suggest moving the
    contents to the new file in NEWS.Debian. postinst will remove old orphaned
    file if it is unmodified. (Closes: #197136)
  * Set return_fail_output instead of return_output on address_pipe transport.
    (Closes: #201280)
  * Stop generating rewriting rules dynamically, exim4 accepts any
    "address-list" item as source-pattern for rewriting. (Changelog entry
    obfuscated on purpose, read exim4debian for painful details.). Remove old
    dynamically generated files in postinst if they were managed by upex4conf.
  * daemon-light supports TLS (Closes: #193596)
