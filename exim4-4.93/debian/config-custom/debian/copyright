This is a custom made configuration package for Debian GNU/Linux's
prepackaged version of exim4, a powerful yet easy to configure mail
transport agent.

This package was originally made by create-custom-package, a script
written by Marc Haber <mh+debian-packages@zugschlus.de> using work
provided by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.
create-custom-package uses the exim4 source package to build this
source package.
