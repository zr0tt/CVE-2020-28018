This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of exim, a powerful yet easy
to configure mail transport agent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This package was put together from the original sources which are
maintained by Philip Hazel <ph10@cus.cam.ac.uk>, and which were
obtained from

	ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/email/exim/

Some modifications to the Makefiles have been made to fit with the Linux
FHS.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The exim content filtering extension, formally known as the
exiscan-acl patch, and which is included in exim4-daemon-heavy,
was written by Tom Kistner <tom@duncanthrax.net>.

Debian Maintainer history:
- The Debian package for exim was originally made by Tim Cutts
  <timc@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org> took over until exim version 3 and is
  still involved with packaging.
- Steve Haslam, Hilko Bengen and Marc Haber generated the initial
  packages of Exim v4.
- The exim4 packages are currently maintained by
  - Core Team
    - (mh) Marc Haber <mh+debian-packages@zugschlus.de> (team leader)
    - (am) Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> (uploader)
  - Commit Privileges
    - (hb) Hilko Bengen <bengen@debian.org> (documentation, hacks etc)
    - (cb) Christian Perrier <bubulle@debian.org> (translations)

The following people helped in preparing the exim4 packages and gave
important feedback:
- Marc Merlin provides the dlopen patch, making it possible to load
  local_scan-routines for a external shared object.
  The original patch was written by David Woodhouse, it was modified first
  by Derrick 'dman' Hudson and afterwards by Marc Merlin.
- Sander Smeenk provided the TLS-docs and the script to generate the
  self-signed certificates.
- The people on the exim4debian list that submitted bug-reports and -fixes,
  and helped with design issues: Matthias Klose, Alexander Koch, Ola
  Lundqvist, Andrew Mulholland, David Pashley, Andreas Piesk, Nick Phillips
  and whoever I forgot to mention.
- syslog2eximlog script by Martin Godisch.
- Hilko Bengen converted the Debian documentation from plain-text to XML
  format.

UNSOLICITED EMAIL
-----------------

The use, supply or promotion of Exim for the purpose of sending bulk,
unsolicited electronic mail is incompatible with the basic aims of the program,
which revolve around the free provision of a service that enhances the quality
of personal communications. The author of Exim regards indiscriminate
mass-mailing as an antisocial, irresponsible abuse of the Internet.


INCORPORATED CODE
-----------------

A number of pieces of external code are included in the Exim distribution.

 .   Support for the cdb (Constant DataBase) lookup method is provided by code
     contributed by Nigel Metheringham of Planet Online Ltd. which contains
     the following statements:
     _________________________________________________________________________

     under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
     Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your
     option) any later version.

     This code implements Dan Bernstein's Constant DataBase (cdb) spec.
     Information, the spec and sample code for cdb can be obtained from
     http://www.pobox.com/~djb/cdb.html. This implementation borrows some code
     from Dan Bernstein's implementation (which has no license restrictions
     applied to it).
     _________________________________________________________________________

     The implementation is completely contained within the code of Exim. It
     does not link against an external cdb library.

 .   Client support for Microsoft's "Secure Password Authentication" is pro-
     vided by code contributed by Marc Prud'hommeaux. Server support was
     contributed by Tom Kistner. This includes code taken from the Samba
     project, which is released under the Gnu GPL.


 .   Support for calling the Cyrus "pwcheck" and "saslauthd" daemons is
     provided by code taken from the Cyrus-SASL library and adapted by
     Alexander S. Sabourenkov. The permission notice appears below, in
     accordance with the conditions expressed therein.
